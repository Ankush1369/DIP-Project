SETTING UP PYTHON ON LAB LINUX MACHINE
Instructions to install python on linux machine: 
sudo apt update
sudo apt install python3

Check:
pip3 --version

If it is working
=> OUTPUT --> pip 9.0.1 from /usr/lib/python3/dist-packages (python 3.6), (or OUTPUT is similar to this,
just a changed pip version)
then skip these instructions:

sudo apt install python3-pip

pip install matplotlib
pip install pandas
pip install numpy


To compile the code:
g++ -std=c++17 bounding_box_segments.cpp -o bounding_box_segments
g++ -std=c++17 MotifDP.cpp -o MotifDP

To run the code:
./bounding_box_segments [test_file_number] 
./MotifDP [test_file_number]

In our case, test_file_number can be 7 or 9 only. Run the same test_file_number for both the 
executables "bounding_box_segments" and "MotifDP"

The code will run on taking whole file as input trajectory and will output the starting and ending 
indicies of both the subtrajectories.

Then to analysize the results, we can plot the results using following:
python3 saving_plots.py

Now a prompt will open and it will ask you to give a file number, as follow:

        Enter test file number: {Enter Number Here}

now you have to give the file number that you gave above.

We will get 4 PNG files in the respective folders of each test data named as test_data7 or test_data9
1. Trajectory.png -> Graphical look of our Trajectory
2. BB_Motif.png -> Motif pair created using bounding_box_segments.cpp
3. DP_Motif.png -> Motif pair created using MotifDP.cpp which is the solution in the paper
4. BoundingBoxes.png -> Provides starting and ending points of Bounding box


BB_Motif.png and DP_Motif.png are the files to be compared and analysized
