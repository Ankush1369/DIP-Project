A spatial trajectory S is defined by a sequence of points
S = <s0, s1, s2, s3, ......., sn-1>
Each point representing coordinates in terms of latitude and longitude , or cartesian coordinates.
A subtrajectory of S is denoted by S[i(start):i(end)] = <si(start), si(start)+1, si(start)+2, ......., si(end)>
0<=i(start)<i(end)<=n-1

A parameter to define similarity between subtrajectories is Discrete Frechet Distance. 
DFD can be calculated by using a recursive relation as follow:

dfd(i(start), i(end), j(start), j(end)) = max(distance(i(end), i(start)),
                                                min(dfd(i(start) , i(end)-1, j(start), j(end)), 
                                                    dfd(i(start) , i(end), j(start), j(end)-1),
                                                    dfd(i(start), i(end)-1, j(start), j(end)-1)
                                                )
                                            )
with base case being i(end)=i(start) and j(end)=j(start)

Motif Discovery:
Motif is defined as most similar disjoint subtrajectory pair for a given trajectory.
Mathematically it is defined as pair of two subtrajectories S[i, ie] and S[j, je]
such that i<ie<j<je and the minimum length of each them being let's say 'k'
which means |ie-i+1|>=k and |je-j+1|>=k and DFD(i, ie, j, je) is minimum for 
all such valid pairs

Input: trajectory S, minimum motif length 'k'
Output: a subtrajectory pair (S[i, ie], S[j, je]) such that
        dfd(i, ie, j, je) is minimal

Frequent Patter Finding:
Frequent pattern refers to set of subtrajectories which includes a bare minimum
number of disjoint subtrajectories with length say 'k' and are similar to 
the representative subtrajectory of that set.
For two subtrajectories to be similar , we assume that they have a upper Bound
on DFD of both the subtrajectories day d(thres)
